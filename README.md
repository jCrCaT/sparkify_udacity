# Sparkify Project udacity nanodegrees
This is a script used to predict client churn from Sparkify, a business used to ilustrate how to work with Spark, a tool used to develop models with a long amount of data as a part of a project of the Datascientist Nanodegree from Udacity.

# Methodology
On this book you are going to find a script that can be used to predict if a client is going to churn or not, but the question is, how is organized the notebook?.
To solve this, Im going to describe the process on the next few lines.

<p><b>Step 1:</b>  Import the libraries - Import all the necesary libraries - </p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b>  Load and clean dataset - Remove unnecesary data - </p>
<p><b>Step 3:</b>  Exploratory data analysis - Getting knowledge from data creating charts and necessary tables - </p>
<p><b>Step 4:</b>  Feature engineriing - Create dataset, features (columns) to make predictions - </p>
<p><b>Step 5:</b>  Modeling  - Process via ML model - </p>

### Installation
To install this script, clone the GitHub repository in your system.
```
git clone https://github.com/jCrCaT/sparkify_udacity.git

```

### Requirements
In order to get all the requirements is necessary to install some packages running the following commands:
```

pip install seaborn
pip install matplotlib
pip install pyspark

```

### Run Script:
In order to run the script, you just need to execute all the codeblocks on the notebook
